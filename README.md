As a part of our curriculum we had a the whole fall of 2023 to develop an app of our choosing. This app was created to streamline tournament brackerts and other scoreboards creation for casual play sessions of table tennis, darts etc. to replace shuffling with pen and paper. My role was to develop a backend to this app using JavaScript and MongoDB to store and handle user data (and the user data security) and all the data regarding the brackets.
